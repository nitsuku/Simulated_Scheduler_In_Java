# Simulated_Scheduler_In_Java
An emulated scheduler that will be testing the success of various scheduling algorithms. 

This is a Java program written in eclipse built off of a Driver class, a Process class
, and a TerminatedProcessException class provided by Patric McKee, a professor teaching
Operating Systems at Rowan University,for an assignment to figure out and implement 
how various scheduling algorithms work in an operating system.


Classes created by me are:
  Node.java
  Clock.java
  Scheduler.java
  
  
In Version 1.0, I implemented the Round Robin algorithm using the classes I created

In Version 2.0, I have revised both the Process class and the Driver class to implement
the Shortest Job First algorithm.

In Version 3.0, I have revised both the Process class and the Driver class to implement
the Lottery algorithm.
